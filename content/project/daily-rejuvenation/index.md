## Aging and rejuvenation – a modular epigenome model

One way to define the concept of biological age is to think of it as the progressive decline in the potential to maintain an equilibrium or steady state.

Methylation of cytosines and guanines at specific positions of the human DNA can predict chronological age and features of biological aging surprisingly well – specifically with a correlation of about 0.96 and prediction error of about 3.6 years. Similarly, the rate of change of the methylations predicts the rate of change of biological age and ill-health. Embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells have a rate of change of near zero. The earliest program that was trained to reveal this fact was the so-called Horvath's epigenetic clock.

It is well-known that the developmental phase of life – from fertilization to sexual maturity – is genetically and epigenetically controlled to happen in an extremely specific way. This gives us the analogy of a programmed biological clock and raises the question how much the aging phase of life is a clock-like process.

On the one hand, it is well-known that plants decline in a clock-like manner and individual cells have clock-like mechanisms of regulated cell death. Many processes could possibly have this clock-like function in the aging human body. On the other hand, the clock-like developmental phase might just stop and the body effectively tries to keep going forever but, for many well-known reasons, damage accumulates and information gets corrupted until the system fails.

Now, combining these ideas, one model to consider is that the epigenetic clock is, in fact, a proper clock of the human aging process. In this case, it should be possible to modify biological age by manipulating the methylations and the effect of this intervention should depend on how the intervention affects clock vs. non-clock methylation sites.

Unfortunately, experimental evidence is still scarce. For example, old human skin fibroblasts can be transformed to the pluripotent state with known dedifferention factors and then back to skin fibroblasts with known differentiation factor. The resulting cells will be just like young human skin fibroblasts. Damage in the old cells is not critical enough not to be repaired in the process. This intervention is called cell rejuvenation by cell reprogramming. Some human trials have explored the effects of different non-reprogramming interventions on the epigenetic clocks in different tissues.

The model of epigenetically driven aging will remain, no doubt, a major area of focus in the field for the near future.
