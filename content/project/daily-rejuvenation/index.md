### Organelle-Specific Autophagy in Cellular Aging and Rejuvenation

[Butsch, T. J., Ghosh, B., & Bohnert, K. A. (2021). Organelle-Specific Autophagy in Cellular Aging and Rejuvenation. Advances in Geriatric Medicine and Research, 3(2).](https://agmr.hapres.com/UpLoad/PdfFile/AGMR_1386.pdf)

The autophagy-lysosome system removes and recycles damaged structures in cells. This process is down- and upregulated in response to the level of stress. During aging, cells accumulate damaged structures until the they fail irrepairably. Thus, if one could somehow increase the functioning of the autophagy-lysosome system, this would be expected to rejuvenate the cells and the tissues that they make up. Such effects can be in fact observed in many organisms with some interventions; the problem that remains is how to do it effectively in humans. How?

Surprisingly little is known about the molecular biology of endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisome, nucleus, and lysosome turnover in humans, in contrast to the turnover of mitochondria (mitophagy). A good approach to learn about these mechanisms is to study cells that use them naturally. For example, reproductive cells, including oocytes, can reset damaged organelles and molecules across generations. Stem cells induce autophagy as part of the system that maintains their regenerative capacity; and the same processes occur when producing induced pluripotent cells. The most well-known substances that are known to induce autophagy include rapamycin, torin1, PP242, curcumin, metformin, resveratrol, trehalose, spermidine, lithium, carbamazepine, and valproic acid. Similarly, known autophagy inhibitors include chloroquine, lys05, wortmannin, bafilomycin A1, spautin-1, and DBeQ.

Understanding the system that manages organelle turnover in cells more accurately will likely be crucial moving forward in order to develop effective rejuvenation therapies.

### Pluripotent Stem Cell-Based Cell Therapy — Promise and Challenges

[Yamanaka, S. (2020). Pluripotent Stem Cell-Based Cell Therapy—Promise and Challenges. Cell stem cell, 27(4), 523-531.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2020.09.014)

Pluripotent stem cells (induced [iPSC] or embryonic [ESC]) have been already studied in many human clinical trials for at least 14 medical conditions. However, three major problems exist until the production of good stem cell therapies will be possible: tumorigenicity (PSC cause tumours), immunogenicity (PSC get rejected), and heterogeneity (too much variation in PSCs).

To prevent tumours, one needs to make sure that the reprogramming factors deactivate, the cells differentiate properly to the correct cell types, and the cell culturing processes don't cause cancer-causing mutations. When producing cell products, one can use antibody-based cell sorting systems, after finding markers that distinguish differentiated and undifferentiated cell types of interest. Tumour formation could be also suppressed after transplantation with inhibitor drugs, intentional HLA mismatch, or suicide genes. Cancer-causing reprogramming factors need to be avoided. Finally, to avoid cancer-causing mutations, one first needs to know which specific mutations in which part of the genome cause cancer in a significant degree in which tissues. Most mutations – even in well-known protein-coding genes – are still 'of unknown significance'. 

Immunogenicity can be probably addressed by using iPSC derived from the patient's own cells but this has many economic and production problems for the time being (2020). Some tissues like the brain and the eye are so 'immune-privileged' that a larger variety of transplations may be possible there. HLA haplotype matching may slightly reduce rejection; such an infrastructure is already in place in clinical hematology (haplotype banking). Another way might be to 'cloak' the HLA regions by deleting common or rejection-critical components or transactivators or by replacing components with less reactive chimeric versions. Otherwise, the patients need to be kept on strong immunosuppressant for the rest of their lives, which has its own harms to weigh against potential benefits of the treatment.

Heterogeneity of embryonic stem cells between and within mice species can be reduced with a so-called 2i-treatment that seems to erase DNA methylations and bring the cells into a similar 'ground state' or 'naive state' (in contrast to 'primed state'). Similar combinations of growth factor inhibitors have been found for human cells. For now, these treatments seem to make the naive cells' DNA more instable as well as erase their imprinted patterns, so the approach needs to be developed further.

### Aging and rejuvenation – a modular epigenome model

[Chiavellini P, Canatelli-Mallat M, Lehmann M, et al. Aging and rejuvenation - a modular epigenome model. Aging (Albany NY). 2021;13(4):4734-4746. doi:10.18632/aging.202712](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7950254/)

One way to define the concept of biological age is to think of it as the progressive decline in the potential to maintain an equilibrium or steady state.

Methylation of cytosines and guanines at specific positions of the human DNA can predict chronological age and features of biological aging surprisingly well – specifically with a correlation of about 0.96 and prediction error of about 3.6 years. Similarly, the rate of change of the methylations predicts the rate of change of biological age and ill-health. Embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells have a rate of change of near zero. The earliest program that was trained to reveal this fact was the so-called Horvath's epigenetic clock.

It is well-known that the developmental phase of life – from fertilization to sexual maturity – is genetically and epigenetically controlled to happen in an extremely specific way. This gives us the analogy of a programmed biological clock and raises the question how much the aging phase of life is a clock-like process.

On the one hand, it is well-known that plants decline in a clock-like manner and individual cells have clock-like mechanisms of regulated cell death. Many processes could possibly have this clock-like function in the aging human body. On the other hand, the clock-like developmental phase might just stop and the body effectively tries to keep going forever but, for many well-known reasons, damage accumulates and information gets corrupted until the system fails.

Now, combining these ideas, one model to consider is that the epigenetic clock is, in fact, a proper clock of the human aging process. In this case, it should be possible to modify biological age by manipulating the methylations and the effect of this intervention should depend on how the intervention affects clock vs. non-clock methylation sites.

Unfortunately, experimental evidence is still scarce. For example, old human skin fibroblasts can be transformed to the pluripotent state with known dedifferention factors and then back to skin fibroblasts with known differentiation factor. The resulting cells will be just like young human skin fibroblasts. Damage in the old cells is not critical enough not to be repaired in the process. This intervention is called cell rejuvenation by cell reprogramming. Some human trials have explored the effects of different non-reprogramming interventions on the epigenetic clocks in different tissues.

The model of epigenetically driven aging will remain, no doubt, a major area of focus in the field for the near future.
