### Rules

1. Everything consists of structures with properties and functions and causal interactions between structures.
2. All knowledge about things can be represented as tidy data structures and programs.
3. Complexity emerges combinatorically from variation in simple structures and causal interactions.
4. Hierarchies must be mutually exclusive.

### Structures

#### Riemannian manifold/space

An informational structure in human culture represented in the language of mathematics. A collection (space) of collections of points, tangent vectors, and metrics. All numbers are real values. All points have disjoint open neighborhoods. At each point, the tangent vector space has positive definite inner products that vary smoothly. Each open set of points can be continuously mapped with a chart to Euclidean space and back while preserving property values.
