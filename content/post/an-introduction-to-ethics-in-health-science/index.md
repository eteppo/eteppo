*This is my 2015 learning diary from a very short health science ethics course.*

## Introduction

This learning diary is based on the three lectures given in the course (Auvinen, Saxen, Launis 2015), the two papers given in the course moodle page (Turoldo 2009, Roberts & Reich 2002) and my own additions without a clear source.

My approach here is to try to focus on sketching some common framework for ethical thinking to help understand the big picture, and then applying it to some (human) health research components. Finally, I'll consider shortly two interesting ethical problems.

## Ethical thinking

Ethics as a subfield of philosophy has a long history since well-known philosophers of the antiquity, such as Plato and Aristotle. Ethics has obviously many somewhat different subfields, such as application area -bounded but overlapping fields like bioethics, medical ethics, and public health ethics. Bioethics, for example, started more formally as a social movement after the World War II and consists of the ethical questions associated with life sciences. (Saxen 2015)

It is useful to divide ethics also to descriptive and normative ethics - that is - to questions of ‘what is considered morally good’ and ‘what is morally good’. In addition, there is the field of meta-ethics that is about the justification of ethical positions (hence the name). The rest of the diary is about normative ethics with a gradual move to human health research. (Saxen 2015)

Ethics and ethical thinking are about asking ‘what is morally good’ (or morally better).

The ‘what’ under consideration are usually a) actions or decisions, b) anything that supposedly results into certain actions or decisions, and c) outcomes that supposedly are or will be the result of some actions and decisions. It is important to note that also inaction is one of the possible actions.

‘The moral good’, then, seems to come down to what is and what causes human well-being and flourishing of societies which gives some working answer to the question 'what is morally good'. Actions and decisions that optimize human well-being and flourishing of societies in a fair manner are morally good.

I could see that this implies already that genuine value decisions should be somewhat common, and there is seldom a global optimum solution – even in extremely hypothetical scenarios with perfect information.

Ethical decision making is, in a strict sense, detecting and solving ethical problems (“uncertainties about goodness”) by considering all of the options and applying empirical knowledge (domain knowledge based on observations) and moral knowledge (critical thinking and ethical theories, principles and rules) to find the morally best decision – or what is morally good in the situation, if anything. (Launis 2015)

There can be many complexities in getting to the morally best decision. There may be many different outcome changes caused by a single upstream change – both on individual- and population-level – which brings in the problems of outcome weighting (individual and population) and fairness in the distribution of harms and benefits (population). Actors may have many other interests than what may be regarded as morally good or best outcomes (conflicts of interest) and power may need to be redistributed. Actors are typically organized in some manner which complicates overall decision making and credit assignment. Actors inevitably will fail to use all generated information that basically exists somewhere. Many of the relevant parts of the problem may be significantly uncertain and the information may not be distributed uniformly among actors (incomplete, asymmetric information; empirically resolvable problems). Genuine ethical problems may not be resolvable due to moral conflict or interpretation problems (what is relevant) (Launis 2015).

The basis of ethical thinking is formalized in the ethical normative theories. Some broad classes of ethical theory include virtue ethics, deontological ethics, consequentialism (includes utilitarianism), communitarianism, and liberalism. (Auvinen 2015, Saxen 2015, Roberts & Reich)

These general ethical theories could be seen to translate to three main levels of ethics. (Auvinen 2015)

First, there are ethical principles. Principles are general cognitive and behavioral traits, guidelines for goals and methods of actions, or values, virtues, duties or rights. These include integrity, conscientiousness, resourcefulness; honesty and sincerity; humility, reflexivity and flexibility; respectfulness, courage; fairness, justice and equity; resoluteness, confidentiality, diligence; openness and transparence; responsibility (for example, societal), objectivity, solidarity, commitment to action; beneficence and non-maleficence; and autonomy (Auvinen 2015). These principles could be seen as high-level a) means to gain moral good, b) means to prevent moral bad, c) form of inherent moral good themselves (ends), or d) any combination of the above. Professional organizations may publish reports of ethical principles as guidelines for others in the field. For example, there are many guidelines concerning human health research, including Nuremberg 1947, Geneva declaration 1948, Helsinki declaration 1964, CIOMS guideline, Council of Europe's guideline, and Belmont report (Auvinen 2015). Guidelines may also include endorsements of rules or policies.

Second, there are ethical rules. Rules are more or less practical statements of requirements for doing some tasks in an ethical manner. For example, there is a rule that the risk-benefit ratio must be favorable in experimental human research. This rule applies both on the participant-level and on the study-level: the risks must be known (to some extent), the participant's interests must be primary, and the study must use reasonable methods to generate benefits via relevant information. There may be some organizations that have the power to set the rules and monitor that they are adhered to. Examples of this in health research are ethics committees and journals that only publish preregistered clinical trials. There may be also initiatives of individuals who set, propose and advocate some ethical rules for practice, as for example, the Peer Reviewers’ Openness (PRO) initiative.

Third, there are ethical policies. Ethical policies are practices of organizations that supposedly prevent some moral violations or increase moral good. These kind of policies in health research include independent, prior review of protocols; having an ethically responsible personnel for every clinical trial; and documenting all participation-consents. Again they may be monitored by organizations.

## Steps of ethical health research process (researcher perspective)

Non-exhaustive list of perspectives on various steps of human health research:

1. Knowing the current view on good research practice and misconduct: An obvious “meta-step” in the beginning of human health research would be to search relevant and current or the most recent guidelines or regulations for good research practice, including (a) ethical guidelines (Helsinki Declaration and others), (b) reporting guidelines, (c) contributorship and authorship guidelines (ICMJE and others), possibly (d) research evaluation lists or tools (the GRADE system, Jadad scale and others), and (e) laws and regulations of the area. These may be seen as the default based on some evidence and consensus, and the researchers’ responsibility is to heavily reason why something else might in the end be morally better.

2. Skilled and qualified research team: Domain experts or expertise is usually required to be able to generate information whose benefits can overweight the harms. The team should not have conflicts of interest, or if it has and if possible, the ways those could affect the research should be blocked. These might happen in the mechanisms of convictions, loyalty, commitment, relationships and financing (Auvinen 2015). The interest should be generating and presenting the most valid (in a broad sense, e.g. a little bias can be induced to gain precision in analyses) information with honesty, and not invalid information even on the basis of potential positive consequences, e.g. meteorologists could overestimate the probability of rain to reduce “unexpected rains”.

3. Correct and fair authorship and contributorship: Authors should distribute the work and credit contributions fairly. Ghost and gift/honorary writers should not be used. Use of professional writers should be presented openly.

4. Ethics committee approval

5. Funding: Researchers’ should be honest when applying for research funding, e.g. not ask funding for work that is already done or that is expected to change dramatically, or exaggerate or misrepresent the importance of the work. Funders and their influence need to be assessed and reported openly. Researchers’ should aim to be as efficient as possible in the task of allocating the money and minimize wasting.

6. Research question/hypothesis selection: Research topic selection should be driven by broad assessment of what is important and impactful for public health and patients, and what is fair from the perspective of all health research done - not just researcher, funder and activist interests. Target populations should be able to contribute to what is studied (meaningful things to them). Questions should aim to be useful for decisions, e.g. asking if a treatment is better than a current standard treatment, instead of other concerns. Systematic review of current information is usually required to fulfill the above conditions and many other properties of a good research question should be considered.

7. Study population selection: All participants should participate voluntarily and do so after understanding what is known of the effects to them and other people (informed consent). Especially risks need to be known to some extent. Vulnerable populations should be used only if there is no other option that could also benefit them. Study population should be provided good overall health care, if applicable.

8. Harm monitoring and stopping criteria: Harms caused by the study interventions should be monitored. Interim analyses should be made with a lower p-value (or other decision metric) threshold for stopping than what is used in the primary analysis to reduce the false positive rate of the study (or achieve this with more advanced methods). 

9. Data management: Data should be managed so that the privacy is preserved (and the data doesn’t get lost). 

10. Reporting: Everything (e.g. project directories) used in the study and related to the study should be reported clearly, honestly, openly, and as comprehensively as possible. Manuscript inevitably presents just the most relevant components of the project. Outcomes and analyses need to be reported with careful balance in the manuscript and abstract as determined before starting the study. Adherence to guidelines will likely fill minimal requirements. Exceptions to this need to have heavy reasons. Confidential material need to be protected by anonymization (many available techniques). Studies should be pre-registered (openness about post-hoc changes). Possible licenses should allow the use of the materials to be as unrestricted as possible (with appropriate credits). All possible conflicts of interests should be reported, including financial and vested interests that might cause cognitive bias.

11. Publication: All research need to be made public independently of the results. All research outside scientific journals should be made public in one way or another. Materials should be in usable and searchable.

12. Communication: Clear communication of the research may be required for openness and even benefits, and might be seen generally as researchers’ responsibility in the society (also as a part of the “transaction” with tax-payers and all donors).

## Examples of ethical problems

Many expected future developments in health-related sciences come with ethical problems. I've been thinking about two cases where by loosening traditional clinical trial practices one could, I guess, gain a lot.

First problematic area is integrating clinical trials in some form to everyday clinical practice, the most important aspect being randomization of treatments. This would have many methodological and resource-related advantages, especially when the process can be automated extensively. But it is also necessary to make steps like informed consent extremely quick, and this seems almost  impossible to do by the standards. But I think the key answer is analogous to weighting the regulation of research in ethics committees according to the clear order of magnitude of the risks involved and not doing the laborious evaluations for every study - simply to trade a little risk for more efficiency to the whole system. 

In this case, experimental high-risk treatments should not be studied in the routine care but focus to the roughly alternative routine diagnosis-treatment-paths. In the "uncertain alternative routine practices" -side of the spectrum, it becomes plainly unethical not to use the everyday patient experience to learn and adjust the health care on the go, finally somewhat reliably. Results should be useful for both quality improvement and medical science.

Another interesting problem is whether patients with some fatal disabling diseases should be allowed to participate to any study if they want to. The main point is that if the disease is fatal or disabling enough for the patient, anything could be simply better than just take the standard treatment and waiting. This time the beneficence and non-maleficence principles would need to bend because even the slightest chance to find something or get meaningful benefits from experimental treatments is considered a better option by the individuals (informed consent). 

The main opposition could go around the slippery slope argument, some practical difficulties, and the doubts about the ability of the patients to make decisions (subjective utility of vulnerable populations), and the discussion becomes somewhat similar to euthanasia debate. Again, future patients could gain a lot of benefit if these kind of trials could be done in some reasonable manner - even with a few of the worst diseases.
