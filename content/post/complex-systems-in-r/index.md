Introduction
------------

What are complex systems? The language of modern science. The point of
this post is that we hack some complex systems models together in R in
increasing complexity and see the models in action for ourselves.

Exponential growth
------------------

Let’s start by modelling a not-so-complex system that has just one
variable called *x*, a parameter called *a*, and the time *t*. This
system follows a simple rule that can be described in the language of
mathematics like this.

<img src="system-1-math.png" width="300" />

In English, the value of *x* at any time point *t* is always it’s value
at the previous time point multiplied by some number *a*.

Finally, we can represent this as a program and visualize how the system
behaves with some values for *a* and *x* at time *t = 0*. Notice the
three key functions for initializing the system, measuring the state of
the system, and updating the state of the system.

``` r
# the double arrow <<- assigns to the global environment, 
# not to the function's environment. usually this is not 
# a good idea but these simulations are easy with <<-.

initialize_system <- function() {
    state <<- tibble(id = "foo", a = 1.1, x = 1, time = 0)
    measurements <<- state
}

measure_state <- function() {
    measurements <<- bind_rows(measurements, state)
}

update_state <- function() {
    state <<- mutate(state, x = a * x, time = time + 1)
}

initialize_system()

for (time in 1:50) {
    update_state()
    measure_state()
}
```

We represent the measurements from the simulation visually. The message:
exponential systems blow up (like a 50 year investment with a steady
return).

If you think equations like this can't have complex behaviours, I recommend to watch the Veritasium video below on the so-called logistic map. It is truly fascinating.

Cyclical behaviour
------------------

The next one will be a bit cooler. We’ll add another variable, *y*, and
pick the following rule.

<img src="system-2-math.png" width="444" />

The programmatic representation is very similar to the previous one.

``` r
initialize_system <- function() {
    state <<- tibble(
        id = "foo", 
        time = 0,
        x = 1,
        y = 1
    )
    
    measurements <<- state
}

measure_state <- function() {
    measurements <<- bind_rows(measurements, state)
}

update_state <- function() {
    state <<- state %>%
        mutate(
            next_x = 0.5 * x + y, 
            next_y = -0.5 * x + y,
            time = time + 1
        ) %>%
        mutate(x = next_x, y = next_y) %>%
        select(-next_x, -next_y)
}

initialize_system()

for (time in 1:50) {
    update_state()
    measure_state()
}
```

And finally, we can visualize the phase space easily since we have two
variables and time.

![](system-2.gif)

Continuous population growth
----------------------------

What if we want to model time continuously instead? We can use
differential equations. Let’s try a so-called logistic population growth
model.

<img src="system-3-math.png" width="247" />

In English, the rate of change of the variable *x* in time *t* at any
particular state is given by the seemingly random calculation on the
right with two parameters, *r* and *K*. Rate of change is clearly
proportional to *r*. We can also see that when *x* is equal to *K*, the
rate of change hits zero!

So let’s simulate this system with some initial values by approximating
it with the corresponding discrete-time model.

``` r
initialize_system <- function() {
    time_step <- 0.1
    
    state <<- tibble(
        id = "foo",
        r = 0.2,
        k = 1,
        x = 0.1,
        time = 0
    )
    measurements <<- state
}

measure_state <- function() {
    measurements <<- bind_rows(measurements, state)
}

update_state <- function() {
    state <<- state %>%
        mutate(
            x = x + r * x * (1 - (x / k)) * time_step,
            time = time + time_step
        )
}

initialize_system()

for (time_steps in 1:500) {
    update_state()
    measure_state()
}
```

![](system-3.gif)

Now the variable doesn’t blow up indefinitely anymore but approaches the
value *K* that we set to one. We managed to model how actual populations
might behave in some situations and the parameter *K* even has a
reasonable interpretation, the carrying capacity of the environment.

Bifurcations
------------

Let’s keep adding complexity slowly. This time we take two variables,
*x* and *y*, and play with the following continuous-time differential
equation that demonstrates us a complex behaviour called a
*bifurcation*, which is a sudden change in a system caused by a small smooth change is a parameter value.

<img src="system-4-math.png" width="287" />

Once again, we represent the same system as a program and simulate it
with some initial values. This time we also check multiple values of
parameters to understand how they affect the system. First, let try
*r = − 1*.

``` r
initialize_system <- function() {
    time_step <<- 0.01
    
    state <<- tibble(
        r = -1,
        x = 0.1,
        y = 0.1,
        time = 0
    )
    measurements <<- state
}

measure_state <- function() {
    measurements <<- bind_rows(measurements, state)
}

update_state <- function() {
    state <<- state %>%
        mutate(
            x_next = x + y * time_step,
            y_next = y + (-r * (x^2 - 1) * y - x) * time_step,
            time = time + time_step
        ) %>%
        mutate(y = y_next, x = x_next) %>%
        select(-x_next, -y_next)
}

initialize_system()

for (time_steps in 1:1000) {
    update_state()
    measure_state()
}
```

![](system-4.gif)

That’s interesting. How about *r = 0*?

![](system-4-2.gif)

So that’s much more stable! Can you guess what happens with *r = 1*?

![](system-4-3.gif)

Just by comparing those animations you get a pretty good intuition of
what bifurcations are. *r* is a bifurcation parameters.

Chaos
-----

We’re slowly working towards more and more complex systems. Now we’ll
level up our game to one of the most famous models that shows us
*chaotic* behaviour, Lorenz equations.

<img src="system-5-math.png" width="235" />

Let’s pick some values for the parameters *s*, *r*, and *b*, and initial
values of 1 for all variables *x*, *y*, and *z*, and write the program
in the usual way.

``` r
initialize_system <- function() {
    time_step <<- 0.01
    
    state <<- tibble(
        r = 30,
        s = 10,
        b = 3,
        x = 1,
        y = 1,
        z = 1,
        time = 0
    )
    measurements <<- state
}

measure_state <- function() {
    measurements <<- bind_rows(measurements, state)
}

update_state <- function() {
    state <<- state %>%
        mutate(
            x_next = x + (s * (y - x)) * time_step,
            y_next = y + (r * x - y - x * z) * time_step,
            z_next = z + (x * y - b * z) * time_step,
            time = time + time_step
        ) %>%
        mutate(
            y = y_next,
            x = x_next,
            z = z_next
        ) %>%
        select(-y_next, -x_next, -z_next)
}

initialize_system()

for (time_steps in 1:1000) {
    update_state()
    measure_state()
}
```

Now that the state or phase space is in three dimensions, we need to get
more general visualization tools. One method is to map time to the
x-axis and make multiple subplots.

![](system-5-1.gif)

Another visualization approach is to take all pairs of variables,
including (*x*, *y*), (*x*, *z*), and (*y*, *z*), and visualize these
two-dimensional subspaces side-by-side. It requires just a little bit
more data wrangling.

![](system-5-2.gif)

The system described by the Lorenz equations clearly has two *attractor
states* – or phase space areas that the state is attracted to and
circulates in this case.

But the state of this Lorenz system is still described by only three
variables and we have simulated just one observational unit (point) at a
time. So now we move on to systems that have many more units and
variables!

Random walkers
--------------

Let’s start by adding units first. This time we skip the mathematical
description and start with English. We model a system that consists of 1000 objects that have just two variables, the positions *x* and
*y*, and of course *time*. The rule is that the positions evolve
completely randomly (from a particulat Gaussian distribution).

``` r
initialize_system <- function() {
    time_step <<- 1
    state <<- tibble(
        x = rnorm(1000, 0, 1),
        y = rnorm(1000, 0, 1),
        time = rep(0, times = 1000)
    )
    measurements <<- state
}

measure_state <- function() {
    measurements <<- bind_rows(measurements, state)
}

update_state <- function() {
    state <<- state %>%
        mutate(
            x = x + rnorm(1000, 0, 0.1),
            y = y + rnorm(1000, 0, 0.1),
            time = time + time_step
        )
}

initialize_system()

for (time_steps in 1:1000) {
    update_state()
    measure_state()
}
```

The state/phase space looks just like you’d expect.

![](system-6.gif)

Cellular automata
-----------------

Now, again, we modify the previous system a bit to demonstrate *interaction* between observational units.

The mathematical description is not very interesting so, in English, we
model a system of 1600 objects packed on a grid, or cells, in the same
two-dimensional space with variables *x* and *y*. This time we also add
a third variable *a* and allow interaction between the objects. The
basic rule for the system is that if an object has *a = 0*, it will
switch to *a = 1* only if four or more of its neighbours have *a = 1*.
Otherwise the object has always *a = 0*. The positions of the objects
don’t change at all.

These kind of systems are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">cellular automata</a> and they can have very interesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergence</a>.

``` r
initialize_system <- function() {
    time_step <<- 1
    n <- 50
    p <- 0.2
    state <<- tibble(
        x = rep(1:n, times = n),
        y = rep(1:n, each = n),
        a = sample(c(0, 1), replace = TRUE, size = n*n, prob = c(1 - p, p)),
        time = rep(0, times = n*n)
    )
    measurements <<- state
}

measure_state <- function() {
    measurements <<- bind_rows(measurements, state)
}

update_state <- function() {
    # neighbors are at (x-1, y-1) and so on
    apply_rule <- function(x_object, y_object, state) {
        state %>%
            filter((x == x_object | x == x_object - 1 | x == x_object + 1) & 
                   (y == y_object | y == y_object - 1 | y == y_object + 1) &
                   !(x == x_object & y == y_object)) %>%
            summarise(a = sum(a)) %>%
            mutate(a = if_else(a > 2, 1, 0)) %>%
            pull(a)
    }
    
    state$a <<- map2_dbl(state$x, state$y, apply_rule, state = state)
    state$time <<- state$time + time_step
}

initialize_system()

pb <- progress::progress_bar$new(total = 20)

for (time_steps in 1:20) {
    pb$tick()
    update_state()
    measure_state()
}
```

Updating many objects’ state one-by-one when the state depends on many
other objects’ states can be very expensive computationally. This is a
major challenge in the field in general.

Since we have three variables, *x*, *y*, and *a*,
and the first two are positions we can use a new visualization trick (in
this post). Namely, we map *x* and *y* to position on the axes and *a*
to the color (fill) of the object.

![](system-7.gif)

That’s a neat simple model for many things that can spread from object
to object, like panic in a tight space from people to people.

Continuous field models
-----------------------

A natural extension to the cellular automata is to switch to more
continuous variables again. That’s how we get *continuous field models*
that can be mathematically described with some new (in this post)
technology called *partial differential equations*. We’ll play with the
following model.

<img src="system-8-math.png" width="444" />

This system has two variables *u* and *v* for each point in (*x*, *y*),
and time *t*, as well as a total of 8 parameters,
{*a*, *b*, *c*, *d*, *h*, *k*, *D*<sub>*u*</sub>, *D*<sub>*v*</sub>}.
*Δ*<sup>2</sup> is the so-called Laplacian operator that’s basically the
second-order derivative (a measure of convexity) in the direction of the
variable that comes after the operator. So, for example, the rate of
change of *u* by time depends on the convexity in the direction of *u*,
in math, *Δ*<sup>2</sup>*u*.

The simple plain language principles that this mathematical model
unintuitively describes become much clearer after we try to simulate and
visualize the system. (We approximate the Laplacian with a simple
cellular automata similar to the one in the previous model.)

initialize_system <- function() {
    # hyperparameters

                    x = x,

        ) %>%

for (time_steps in 1:10) {
    pb$tick()
    update_state()
    measure_state()
}
```

We apply the same visualization technique as before for *u* and *v*
separately.

![](system-8-1.gif)![](system-8-2.gif)

Unfortunately, almost nothing seems to happen with the parameters used
but we get the idea. Continuous fields are like continuous versions of
cellular automata.

Dynamical network models
------------------------

Next, we dive into *dynamical network models*. To represent them, we’ll
need to add some mathematical language of graph theory into our toolbox.

We’ll focus on the so-called adaptive networks because they combine both
the dynamics *on* and *of* networks, i.e., they allow both the nodes
(objects, units, people) and the edges (unit relationships, friendship,
physical contact) to change. If the previous modelling tools felt too
restricted, adaptive networks are a very general framework for modelling
complex sets of assumptions.

We’ll model and simulate the following adaptive network model.

<img src="system-9-math.png" width="401" />

In natural language, we have a bunch of units indexed with *i* with some
state given by its variable *c*. The rate of change of the state by time
*t* depends on the unit’s neighbors’ states (indexed with *j*) like in
previous models. However, this time we have also the variable *w* that
is a variable of the *relationships* between the neighbors, noted by the
*ij* subscripts. In graph theory language, *c* is a node variable and
*w* is an edge variable, and because they both change, we have an
adaptive network model.

This particular model has been developed to be a simplified sociological
model of groups of people and social contagion.

Let’s simulate one particular famous network called the karate club that initially
contains two distinct groups with states *c = 0.9* and *c = 0.1* and all
of the existing relationships have weight *w = 0.4*. As usual, we pick
some values for the other parameters and see what happens. (Again, a
quick and dirty implementation I’m afraid…)

``` r
initialize_system <- function() {
    # hyperparameters
    a <<- 1
    b <<- 3
    g <<- 3
    time_step <<- 0.01
    
    timer <<- 0
    # the first graph
    graph <<- karate %>%
        as_tbl_graph() %>%
        mutate(c = if_else(Faction == 1, 0.9, 0.1)) %>%
        select(name, c) %>%
        mutate(time = timer) %>%
        activate(edges) %>%
        rename(w = weight) %>%
        mutate(w = 0.4, time = timer) %>%
        activate(nodes)
    
    # measure graph and time separately for now
    measured_graph <<- graph
    measured_time <<- timer
}

measure_state <- function() {
    measured_graph <<- graph %N>%
        mutate(time = timer) %E>%
        mutate(time = timer) %N>%
        bind_graphs(measured_graph)
    
    measured_time <<- append(measured_time, timer)
}

update_state <- function() {
    
    # mote the c and w equations
    # here we define them first and
    # then apply them below
    c_model <- function(neighborhood, graph, node) {
        # get neighborhood data
        nc <- neighborhood %>%

So the model predicts that the two groups polarize as time goes on.
Whether this is actually an accurate sociological model for some kind of
state and relationship is another topic but it’s surely a precise and
testable description of a hypothesis, like all science aims to be!

Agent-based models
------------------

Finally, we dive into the last modelling framework in this post and it
is the most general of them all: *agent-based models*.

Agent-based models are most naturally described in the language of
[object-oriented
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
instead of graph theory and equations because each node (unit, agent)
can be arbitrarily complex and interact with other agents as well as
with arbitrarily complex environments.

But because agent-based modelling is general, you can basically use it
as the framework to model the most simple systems too which makes it a
really powerful tool.

Let’s build a model of 200 agents with features *x*, *y*, and *type*. The
rule is that the agents jump randomly in the grid until they find a
neighborhood with a certain proportion of agents of the same type. You
could think of this as another simple model of social segregation.

Let’s get coding.

``` r
initialize_system <- function() {

    n_agents <<- 200
    radius <<- 0.2
    threshold <<- 0.6

    # classes have upper-cased first letters by general convention
    # we use R's Reference Class (RC) system; it works just like Python classes etc.
    Agent <<- setRefClass(
        Class = "Agent",
        # variables
        fields = list(
            id = "numeric",
            type = "numeric", 
            x = "numeric", 
            y = "numeric", 
            time = "numeric"
        )
    )
    
    measurements <<- tibble(.rows = 0)
    
    agents <<- list()
    for (i in 1:n_agents) {
        agent <- Agent()
        
        agent$id <- i 
        agent$type <- rbinom(n = 1, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
        agent$x <- runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 1)
        agent$y <- runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 1)
        agent$time <- 0
        
        agents <<- append(agents, agent)
    }
}

measure_state <- function() {

    for (agent in agents) {
        
        agent_state <- tibble(
            id = agent$id,
            type = agent$type, 
            x = agent$x, 
            y = agent$y, 
            time = agent$time
        )
        
        measurements <<- bind_rows(measurements, agent_state)
    }
}

update_state <- function() {
    
    next_agents <- list()
    # shuffle order of agents
    agents <<- sample(agents)
    
    for (agent in agents) {
        
        neighbor_types <- c()
        for (neighbor in agents) {
            
            distance <- ((agent$x - neighbor$x)^2 + (agent$y - neighbor$y)^2)
            is_within_radius <- distance < radius^2
            not_self <- agent$id != neighbor$id
            is_neighbor <- not_self & is_within_radius
            
            if (is_neighbor == TRUE) {
                neighbor_types <- append(neighbor_types, neighbor$type)
            }
        }
        
        if (length(neighbor_types) > 0) {
            
            proportion_same_type <- sum(neighbor_types == agent$type) / 
                                    length(neighbor_types)
            
            if (proportion_same_type < threshold) {
                agent$x <- runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 1)
                agent$y <- runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 1)
            }
            
        }
        
        agent$time <- agent$time + 1
        
        next_agents <- append(next_agents, agent)

    agents <<- next_agents

Conclusion
----------

In summary, we got some intuition on dynamical equations, cellular
automata, networks models, and agent-based models. To continue your
journey to the wonderful world of complex systems, I recommend reading
the Hiroki Sayama's book
[here](https://textbooks.opensuny.org/introduction-to-the-modeling-and-analysis-of-complex-systems/) next.

Extra notes
-----------

I used the following R packages and functions in the post.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(tidygraph)
library(gganimate)
library(ggraph)

library(igraphdata)
data(karate)

visualize_state <- function(data, ..., alpha = 0.2, wake_length = 0.9, size = 3) {
    
    spec <- ggplot(data = data, aes(...)) +
        geom_point(size = size) +
        transition_states(time) +
        ease_aes("linear") +
        shadow_wake(wake_length = wake_length, alpha = alpha) +
        theme_minimal()

    animate(spec, duration = 5)
   
}

visualize_adaptive_net <- function(graph, time) {
    plot <- graph %>%
        ggraph(layout = "kk") +
            geom_node_point(aes(color = c), size = 4) +
            geom_edge_fan(aes(alpha = w, width = w)) +
            scale_color_gradient(low = "white", high = "black", limits = c(0, 1)) +
            scale_edge_width(range = c(0, 2), limits = c(0, 1)) +
            scale_edge_alpha_continuous(limits = c(0, 1)) +
            theme_graph() +
            ggtitle(str_c("Time: ", round(time, 2)))
    
    return(plot)
}
```
