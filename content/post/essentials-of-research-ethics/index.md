_This is my summary of a health research ethics paper titled "Essentials of Research Ethics for Healthcare Professionals" that I wrote for a short course on the topic in 2015._

## Introduction

Every once in a while, cases of scientific misconduct draw attention to back to the fundamental questions, _research ethics_. Research ethics has been defined as 'the moral problems encountered in connection with scientific or other academic research, by the researcher, their subjects or their social environment’ (Berg & Tranøy, 1983; p. XIII).

The article was targeted for healthcare professionals doing human health research, and asks basics questions that they recommend to be covered in the basic education of healthcare professionals.

## Which ethical theories serve as a foundation for ethical principles in research ethics? 

Central ethical theories for research ethics are consequentialism (act and rule approach), deontological theory, and ethical universalism and relativism. 

By consequentalist logic, actions that produce the best outcome for the highest number of people are the most ethical. The act-based approach is to consider certain acts in certain circumstances, and rule-based approach is to formulate general rules. In research, one would need to estimate possible effects of the research to participants and future patients. 

In deontological terms, the action is considered good or bad regardless of consequences. In research, one would consider the possible effects to the participants only.

Ethical relativism refers to principles that are not generalizable to all cultures, while ethical universalism refers to all-inclusive principles. Exploring ethical diversity due to cultural diversity or otherwise is recommended to prevent ethical dilemmas.

## What ethical principles should a researcher respect when conducting research with human subjects? 

Firstly, as emphasized by the Nuremberg code, researchers should respect the principles of (1) informed consent (respect for autonomy; deontological) , (2) freedom from coercion (respect for autonomy; deontological) and (3) an appropriate risk-benefit ratio for the subjects (beneficence; consequentalist). Declaration of Helsinki adds to informed consent that the consent can be provided in special cases by a 'legal guardian'. It also stratifies ethical guidance according to whether the study is interventional (consequentalist). The Belmont report emphasizes also (4) justice (fairness) in selection processes.

Consent form should be an invitation to participate into a study of which purpose, criteria, procedures, possible study treatments and alternative treatments, and the benefits and risks associated with participating, including confidentiality, anonymity and privacy risks, are made clear. Also opportunities to get questions answered and copies of the consent forms should be available.

With the principles of autonomy one needs to be aware of vulnerable populations, or vulnerability due to comprehension problems or social pressures.

Much of research is also (5) regulated by governmental bodies and ethics boards.

## What does it mean to conduct research ethically?

In addition to ethical principles summarized above, ethical conduct of research can be approached from four directions. 

First, Model of Professional Responsibility includes six duties for a researcher: "(i) to conduct research; and (ii) to evaluate the consequence of research, as well as four negative duties: (i) not to conduct research that violates informed consent; (ii) not to conduct research that converts public resources into private profit; (iii) not toconduct research that seriously jeopardizes environmental welfare; and (iv) not to conduct biased research (Shrader-Frechette, 1994)."

Second, ethical conduct requires four personal psychological processes: moral sensitivity, reasoning, commitment, and perseverance.

Third, honesty is an important virtue of a researcher. This means that researcher should be commited to disseminate scientific truth and avoid types of scientific misconduct, such as fabrication, conflict of interest, misrepresentations, and misappropriations.

## What ethical dilemmas are encountered by a researcher in conducting research?

Ethical thinking is part of all stages of the research process. Qualitative studies and experimental studies may be more prone to ethical dilemmas than quantitative observational studies. For example, reliable evaluation of chances and risks may be especially difficult in qualitative studies. On the other hand, experimental human studies need a genuine uncertainty of which evaluation may be difficult. 

Measurement methods may have privacy risks. It may also be hard to avoid coercion in recruitment when the researchers need to make people interested about participating and get some pre-defined number of participants in. It is recommended that professional need to consult their discipline's contemporary ethical standards when doing research.
