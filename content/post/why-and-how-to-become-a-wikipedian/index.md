If you're not convinced why you should help build Wikipedia, give a chance to the second main paragraph below. I start by assuming you already are.

### Everything you need to know about editing Wikipedia

The movement behind Wikipedia is called the <a href="https://www.wikimedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikimedia</a>. Other Wikimedia's projects that you should consider checking out and contributing to include the <a href="https://www.wikibooks.org/" target="_blank">Wikibooks</a> project.

All languages have their own main sites, e.g., the English Wikipedia is at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">en.wikipedia.org</a> and the Finnish at _fi.wikipedia.org_.
All articles have a URL like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing/" target="_blank">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing</a>. Now you can easily go directly to the article if you guess its title correctly.

A couple of namespaces organize some special articles and other meta stuff.

Articles like _en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Namespace_ and _.../wiki/Help:Contents_ from the Wikipedia and Help namespaces include information about the Wikipedia itself, and articles like _en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Clinical\_Medicine_ from the Category namespace include a tree of category-pages where people can find all articles related to a particular high-level topic. Unfortunately, the categorizations seem to be quite incomplete and the quality varies (another reason to help fix the contents of a category of things you know a lot about). URLs such as _...wiki/User:User_ refers to pages describing wikipedians themselves, and URLs like _...wiki/Talk:Ageing_ link to the discussion page of the article. Finally, the URL _.../wiki/Template:Reflist_ is one of the templates (`{{reflist}}`) that help organize and inject structured information like references and infoboxes to the articles.

It's probably wise to create an anonymous account.

When you have an account, go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sandbox" target="_blank">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sandbox</a>. You can edit articles by using the visual interface but I highly recommend taking some time to learn the _Wikitext_ or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Cheatsheet" target="_blank">Wiki markup language</a>. This lets you write, copy, save, and paste text easily because its the raw text that the MediaWiki software renders to be the final visually pleasing article. It also helps you understand how links, citations, images, and so on work under the hood in Wikipedia.

Here's everything you need to know about _Wikitext_ to get started (note that different languages have their own translated mark up too):

* `''italics''` and `'''bold'''` are self-explanatory.
* `[[Page]]` adds a link to page wiki Page to the word "Page".
* `[[Page|pages]]` adds a link to wiki page Page to the word "pages".
* `[[Page#Subsection|Subsection]]` adds a link to wiki subsection Page#Subsection to the word "Subsection".
* `<ref name="google">[https://google.com Google]</ref>` adds a reference to external URL.
* `<ref name="google">Someone et al. Title. Journal 12;345-5445.</ref>` adds a reference to a journal article.
* `{{reflist}}` tells the MediaWiki software to place the list of reference (as marked up with the `<ref>`-tags) in the specific place. The reference list `reflist` is a standard template.
* `{{cn` is the famous _[citation needed]_ that you can add after a claim that lacks a reference.
* `[[File:filename.png|thumb|Caption]]` adds the file that has been previously uploaded to Wikipedia. Search for Wikipedia extended image syntax when you need more settings.
* `[[Category:Name]]` adds the wiki page to category Name usually placed at the bottom of the article's Wikitext.
* `#REDIRECT [[Target page]]` at the first line is also self-explanatory. You need this if the title of the article is bad because titles cannot be changed. You need to create a new page and redirect the old one to the new one.
* `==Subsection==` ẃith two equal signs is a level two subtitle that is actually the highest level title in the article.
* `*` and `#` make bulleted and numbered lists.

Search for the help pages if you want to make fancier things like tables and quotes.

### Why you should become a wikipedian

Knowledge moves our world forward. While there are many obstacles in the path to getting accurate knowledge (true justified beliefs) from low-level sources like scientific articles to the minds and actions of the people, one of the most important factors is accessibility.

Wikipedia is the most used source of high-level, textbook-like information on any imagineable topic. Whatever is your personal field of expertise and whatever are the authorative sources in your field, most people probably learn about those topics from Wikipedia.

When you go and read about the topics of your expertise from Wikipedia, you'll very likely see that the articles are not good. For smaller languages, the articles probably don't even exist.

What might be the effects of people being able to learn more about the things that you know about? Experts need to learn to resist their harmful gatekeeping incentives and realize that the openness also creates a positive force for the experts to improve and provide more value to the world – instead of just blocking access to lower levels of value.

Editing Wikipedia is volunteering but there's a lot you get from it too. Many use editing as a learning tool; when you're forced to read, fix, and summarize some material, you tend to learn it better yourself. By checking sources and their validity and reliability you get to develop your critical thinking skills, and by writing educational content you get to practice your pedagogical writing skills.

If you're a teacher, a scientist, and so on, it could be claimed that part of your professional responsibilities is to educate the public. Editing Wikipedia – the number one encyclopedia of the world – is a big part of that. Instead of writing a closed pricey book, you should consider writing free open materials and use them in your teaching. You'll have a lot more success.

Wikipedia has been built by countless volunteers for all of humanity to benefit from. Open-source development by large communities in general is extremely effective and is slowly making for-profit information industries obsolete as we go deeper into the information age.
