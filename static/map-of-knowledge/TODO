youtube screen ratio (or detect screen ratio and use that adaptively)
text wrapping
description field under name
refactor code
hover and click only to next level (without labels no idea what's inside)
make it so that clicking circle doesn't get you back one level
OR make a hovering tooltip
size = number of characters?
circles to ellipses? (background radiation like map!)
maybe show labels one level down too (small font), guides clicking
prevent overlap of labels
